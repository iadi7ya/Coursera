Afterwards, you train your model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set. To finish this exercise, you will past the accuracy of your model to the Coursera grader.\n\nThis notebook is tested in IBM Watson Studio under python 3.6\n\n##\u00a0Data\n\nFor this exercise we will use the Reuters newswire dataset. This dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.\n\n## Goal\n\nWe want to create a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras which we can train to classify news items into the specified 46 topics.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe start by installing and importing everything we need for this exercise:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "!pip install --upgrade keras-applications keras-preprocessing setuptools tensorflow==1.14.0 keras==2.2.5", "execution_count": 1, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "Requirement already up-to-date: keras-applications in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (1.0.8)\nRequirement already up-to-date: keras-preprocessing in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (1.1.0)\nRequirement already up-to-date: setuptools in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (45.2.0)\nRequirement already up-to-date: tensorflow==1.14.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (1.14.0)\nRequirement already up-to-date: keras==2.2.5 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (2.2.5)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: numpy>=1.9.1 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from keras-applications) (1.15.4)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: h5py in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from keras-applications) (2.9.0)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: six>=1.9.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from keras-preprocessing) (1.12.0)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: wrapt>=1.11.1 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (1.11.1)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: gast>=0.2.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (0.2.2)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: google-pasta>=0.1.6 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (0.1.8)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: wheel>=0.26 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (0.32.3)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: protobuf>=3.6.1 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (3.6.1)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: grpcio>=1.8.6 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (1.16.1)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: tensorflow-estimator<1.15.0rc0,>=1.14.0rc0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (1.14.0)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: astor>=0.6.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (0.7.1)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: termcolor>=1.1.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (1.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: absl-py>=0.7.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (0.7.0)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: tensorboard<1.15.0,>=1.14.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==1.14.0) (1.14.0)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: pyyaml in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from keras==2.2.5) (3.13)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: scipy>=0.14 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from keras==2.2.5) (1.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: werkzeug>=0.11.15 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorboard<1.15.0,>=1.14.0->tensorflow==1.14.0) (0.14.1)\nRequirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: markdown>=2.6.8 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorboard<1.15.0,>=1.14.0->tensorflow==1.14.0) (3.0.1)\n", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import tensorflow\nif not tensorflow.__version__ == '1.14.0':\n    print(tensorflow.__version__)\n    raise ValueError('please upgrade to TensorFlow 1.14.0, or restart your Kernel (Kernel->Restart & Clear Output)')\n\nimport keras\nif not keras.__version__ == '2.2.5':\n    print(keras.__version__)\n    raise ValueError('please upgrade to Keras 2.2.5, or restart your Kernel (Kernel->Restart & Clear Output)')", "execution_count": 2, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "Using TensorFlow backend.\n", "name": "stderr"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "IMPORTANT! => Please restart the kernel by clicking on \"Kernel\"->\"Restart and Clear Outout\" and wait until all output disapears.
